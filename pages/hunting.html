            <p>Have you ever heard of the hunter which blood boils with sin? The hunter named after a prophet, Ezekiel. A folklorish figure, that guy. They say he's a coward that know he has no redemption beyond death. Being to scared to kill himself, he tries to force others to do the deed. How? By putting them through hell.</p>

            <p>...just so you know, that's all false. While I did commit more than one murder, I've never gone beyond taking life. And even then, it's not like I'm proud of it. But at least, I can say to myself that those people deserved it.</I></p>
